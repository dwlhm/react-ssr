/**
 * Nodes for constructing a reactive graph of reactive values and reactive computations.
 * The graph is acyclic.
 * The user inputs new values into the graph by calling set() on one more more reactive nodes.
 * The user retrieves computed results from the graph by calling get() on one or more reactive nodes.
 * The library is responsible for running any necessary reactive computations so that get() is
 * up to date with all prior set() calls anywhere in the graph.
 *
 * We call input nodes 'roots' and the output nodes 'leaves' of the graph here in discussion,
 * but the distinction is based on the use of the graph, all nodes have the same internal structure.
 * Changes flow from roots to leaves. It would be effective but inefficient to immediately propagate
 * all changes from a root through the graph to descendant leaves. Instead we defer change
 * most change progogation computation until a leaf is accessed. This allows us to coalesce computations
 * and skip altogether recalculating unused sections of the graph.
 *
 * Each reactive node tracks its sources and its observers (observers are other
 * elements that have this node as a source). Source and observer links are updated automatically
 * as observer reactive computations re-evaluate and call get() on their sources.
 *
 * Each node stores a cache state to support the change propogation algorithm: 'clean', 'check', or 'dirty'
 * In general, execution proceeds in three passes:
 *  1. set() propogates changes down the graph to the leaves
 *     direct children are marked as dirty and their deeper descendants marked as check
 *     (no reactive computations are evaluated)
 *  2. get() requests that parent nodes updateIfNecessary(), which proceeds recursively up the tree
 *     to decide whether the node is clean (parents unchanged) or dirty (parents changed)
 *  3. updateIfNecessary() evaluates the reactive computation if the node is dirty
 *     (the computations are executed in root to leaf order)
